# Notes
notes: |
  Goose has TWO distinct Claude integration paths:
  1. ClaudeCodeProvider - spawns `claude` CLI as persistent subprocess with stream-json NDJSON protocol
  2. AnthropicProvider - direct Anthropic API access via anthropic crate
  The CLI integration is unique in the ecosystem for using persistent process + NDJSON bidirectional communication
  rather than per-request spawning.
