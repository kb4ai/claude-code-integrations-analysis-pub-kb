  Deep native Anthropic SDK integration (anthropic ^0.47). Does NOT invoke Claude CLI.
  Features: streaming (messages.stream), extended thinking with configurable budget,
  prompt caching (ephemeral cache_control on system + last 2 user messages),
  vision (base64 images), native web search (web_search_20250305), tool use,
  constrained output via Pydantic schemas, MCP server integration, ACP protocol support.
  Model-aware: temperature=1 for reasoning models, top_p omitted.
  Environment-driven config: GPTME_REASONING, GPTME_REASONING_BUDGET, GPTME_ANTHROPIC_WEB_SEARCH.
