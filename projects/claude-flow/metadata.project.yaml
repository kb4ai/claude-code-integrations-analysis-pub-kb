analysis_status: "comprehensive"

notes: |
  Most sophisticated CLI orchestration in the ecosystem. Spawns multiple Claude Code
  instances with phase-based parallel execution (Promise.allSettled), stream chaining
  via stdout→stdin piping, DAG-based dependency resolution with cycle detection,
  NDJSON output parsing, hooks integration, and memory coordination.
  Supports interactive, non-interactive, and headless (CI/Docker) modes.
