notes: |
  Cline has TWO distinct Claude integration paths:
  1. AnthropicHandler - direct @anthropic-ai/sdk v0.37.0 with streaming, prompt caching, extended thinking
  2. ClaudeCodeHandler - spawns Claude Code binary via execa with stream-json output
  Both are first-class providers with UI configuration. Claude Code provider disables images
  and prompt caching since CLI doesn't support those features directly.
