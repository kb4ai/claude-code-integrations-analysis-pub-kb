notes: |
  Anthropic's official cookbook repository. Contains canonical examples for all integration patterns:
  1. Claude Agent SDK: 3 progressive tutorials (research agent, chief-of-staff, observability)
     using ClaudeAgentOptions + ClaudeSDKClient with query()/receive_response() pattern
  2. Claude Code: .claude/commands/ (7 custom commands), .claude/skills/ (cookbook-audit),
     GitHub Actions workflows for automated PR review and notebook quality
  3. SDK patterns: messages.create, messages.stream, extended thinking, prompt caching,
     tool use, vision, batch processing, JSON mode, memory tool (beta)
  4. MCP: Docker-containerized MCP servers (GitHub, git) with allowed/disallowed tools
  5. Skills: cookbook-audit skill with validation scripts and scoring rubrics
  Registry has 150+ cookbook entries covering RAG, classification, summarization, etc.
